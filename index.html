        <h2>Why File Income Tax Returns (ITRs)?</h2>
        <p>Filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) is crucial for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legal Compliance</strong>: It's a legal requirement in most countries for individuals whose income exceeds a certain threshold. Compliance ensures you avoid penalties and legal consequences.</li>
            <li><strong>Documenting Income</strong>: ITRs serve as official documentation of your income, essential for various purposes like applying for loans, visas, or government benefits.</li> 
            <li><strong>Tax Deductions and Credits</strong>: By filing your ITRs, you can claim deductions and tax credits applicable to you, reducing your taxable income and potentially resulting in a tax refund.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency and Accountability</strong>: Filing ITRs showcases your financial transparency, contributing to the integrity of the tax system and ensuring accountability.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoiding Penalties</strong>: Timely filing of ITRs helps you avoid penalties and interest charges, ensuring you stay compliant with tax laws.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Planning</strong>: Regular filing of ITRs provides insights into your financial situation, aiding in informed financial planning, including budgeting and investments.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="missed-itr">
        <h2>What Happens if You Miss the ITR Filing Deadline?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interest:</strong> If you submit your return after the deadline, you will be liable to pay interest at a rate of 1% per month or part month on the unpaid tax amount as per Section 234A.</li>
            <li><strong>Late Fee:</strong> In case of late filing, Section 234F imposes a late fee of Rs.5,000, which shall be reduced to Rs.1,000 if your total income is below Rs.5 lakh.</li>
            <li><strong>Loss Adjustment:</strong> In case you have incurred losses from sources like the stock market, mutual funds, properties, or any of your businesses, you have the option to carry them forward and offset them against your income in the subsequent year. This provision substantially reduces your tax liability in future years. However, you will not be allowed to carry forward these losses if you miss filing your ITR before the deadline.</li>
            <li><strong>Belated Return:</strong> If you miss the ITR filing due date, you can file a return after the due date, called a belated return. However, you will still have to pay the late fee and interest charges, and you will not be allowed to carry forward any losses for future adjustments. The last date for filing a belated return is 31st December of the assessment year (unless extended by the government). Therefore, for this year, you may submit the belated return by 31 December 2024 at the latest.</li>
            <li><strong>Updated Return:</strong> Still, if you miss the 31st December deadline due to unavoidable reasons, you can file the updated (ITR U) return subject to the conditions specified therein.</li>
        </ul>
